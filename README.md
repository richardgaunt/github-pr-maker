[![Tests](https://github.com/user/github-pr-builder/workflows/test/badge.svg)]

🎯 GitHub PR Maker generates PRs using your commit history and a standardized template.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. 🎫 Ticket number (e.g., JIRA-123)
2. 📝 Pull Request title
3. ✅ Whether your changes include tests
4. 🔄 Which recent commits to include (with ability to edit descriptions)

It then:
- 📋 Generates a PR using your template with all provided information
